# TODO

Laundry list of bugs, incomplete bits, etc:
* Not all section types are decoded/recognized
* Custom 'name' sections can be further decoded and used to annotate functions,
  modules, etc.  See appendix 7.4
* Better logging module/support
* Add module/section validation and make -v option meaningful
